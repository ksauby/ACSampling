\title{Calculate the Horvitz-Thompson Ratio Estimator}
\usage{
R_hat(y, x, N, n1, m_vec, replace = "FALSE")
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The variable of interest, \eqn{y}. Must be a numeric vector. The criterion that determines whether adaptive cluster sampling takes place is based on this variable.}

\item{x}{A vector of values for variable $x$, which is auxiliary data about the variable of interest $y$.}

\item{N}{Population size.}

\item{n1}{An integer giving the initial sample size (e.g., a simple random sample).}

\item{m_vec}{Vector of values \eqn{m} for the set of units in a sample, of length \eqn{n1}. Each \eqn{m} value within the vector \code{m_vec} denotes the number of units satisfying the ACS criterion for the network \eqn{i} to which the unit belongs.}

\item{replace}{Whether sampling should be done with or without replacement. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
R_hat is calculated by dividing the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, Tau_hat_z by Tau_hat_x. See p. 77, Thompson (2002). THERE CANNOT BE NAS IN X OR Y?
