\title{Select a sample of cells from the grid population and randomly assign species information.}
\usage{
sampleGridPop(grid, n.networks, cluster.centers, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{A dataframe of x and y coordinates (can be created with \code{createPop}).}

\item{n.networks}{The number of networks to be placed in the realization.}

\item{cluster.centers}{Dataframe including x and y coordinates and network IDs for the centers of clusters.}

\item{seed}{Vector of numbers to be given to \code{set.seed()}. Two numbers are used: the first to determine the sample of locations and the second to determine the sample of species information to be assigned to the sample locations.}
}
\description{
This function uses two random numbers: the first to set the seed to sample locations from a grid, and the second to sample networks to assign to those locations (more specifically, the centers of the networks are assigned to those locations).
